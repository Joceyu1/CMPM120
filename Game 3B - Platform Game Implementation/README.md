**Game 3B :: Platform Game Implementation**

Game Name :: Floaty Stays Afloat â€“ 
Players have to maintain the game character, who is named as Floaty, to stay afloat on the platform (maybe 2 or 3 pixels away from the ground) and overcome obstacles (which kills Floaty once Floaty collides/touches them such as enemy sprites).
